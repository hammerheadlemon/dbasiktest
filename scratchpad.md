## Todo

* Refactor `ReturnParser`.
* getDatamap() needs to throw exception rather than return null; also check other methods in this class for same.
* Can we obtain integers from the parser, or must it be doubles?
* Get rid of `com.matthewlemon.datamaps.core.parser.DatamapType`.
* **DONE** Ability to be able to get datamapline from datamp by querying the key name, rather than the index.
* Refactor InMemoryDatamapShould test.
