## Datamaps Core

This is actually called *Datamaps Core*, not dbasik. That was it's old name.
Now it is written in Java, not in Python, so it gets a new name and a new life,
based on a different virtual machine. A faster one. One that makes is
potentially more deployable on a desktop, installable by humans rather than
nerds. And a GUI comes with it.

That's another repo.
